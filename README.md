# RandomFragment
This is a simple web page for viewing a random fragment from the mysterious and ambiguous collection of sayings attributed to Heraclitus. 
Will eventually be incorporated in an index webpage of verses I revere that recognize the unity of opposites; one such one shall be the Tao Te Ching.

There are already a bunch of webpages containing these fragments, but they all have them as clumsy lists that you have to navigate by index. 
I believe randomness and the element of surprise is a far better serving method for dealing with the likes of these fragments: 
one can find in this a connection to the I Ching, and how its contents are accessed solely through randomness, e.g. through tossing coins. 
This page, and eventually the parent index it'll belong to, is like a means for accessing fragments of wisdom without needing to know where to look for them -
this is the best way to deal with them. Might also include bits from the I Ching in the eventual version.

This page omits the index number of the fragment - and this is a feature. 

v001 or smth:
contains some regex issues like having random ","s or " "s printed on the page on the occasion, but works mostly rather well.
